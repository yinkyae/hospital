              Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say:
              “Call 911.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using
              both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the
              person’s chest. Let their chest come back up naturally between
              compressions. Keep going until someone with more training arrives.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you’re trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and
              rescue breathing.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it’s available, use an AED. However, do not put off doing chest
              compressions to go look for an AED. If possible, instruct someone
              else to go find the device and bring it to you.
